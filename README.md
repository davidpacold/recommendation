# My Twilio App Demo

This is my app and walkthough of how to build an app using Twilio functionality.

I reciently started at Twilio, and as part of the onboarding process is the opportunity to earn a red track jacket. You earn this jacket by building and demoing an app that you make using the twilio platform - this takes you out of your day to day role and into the constumers shoes, giving a sense of comroddery with the customers, reading the same docs, understaing how things work, and common language to speak - all good things! 



This project will document my journey to earning my Track Jacket! Here I will be outlining the general process of setting up a Twilio account, the steps I followed to learn and build my app, and provide some tips and tricks as I learn them.

As we kick off, here are the rough high level things we will go though: 

 Brainstorming app ideas
- Setting up my developlment environmnet
- Setting up a Twilio account
- Reviewing and learning about the API's aviable to me 
- making my app
- testing the app

So lets dig in! 


Some of my ideas for the app are:

- a number guessing app, the server generates a random number between 1 and 10, and then the user guesses a number, the server returns a match or a clue
- a photo a day collage app, the user is prompted to submit a picture of what they are doing at that moment. At the end of the week a montage of the photos is returned
- a mad lib generating app, the user is prompted for a noun, verb, etc.. and the end result is a completed mad lib.
- a photo identifier application, submit a picture and have it analyzed for content, think silicon valley tv show, hot dog or no hot dog ha!
- a music recommendation app, send in a band you like and get a new music suggestion in return 


While like a proud parent, I love all my ideas equally, the one I am going to pick is the music recomemndation applicaiton. 

Now lets break this down a bit and think about what we want out of our app, and the building blocks to create it.
